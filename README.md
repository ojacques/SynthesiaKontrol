# Synthesia Kontrol Guide
Use Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol MK1 and MK2 light guide in Synthesia to learn keyboard.

This is a project for my son, which you may find useful.

This program listens to light events from Synthesia sent to a virtual `LoopBe1` midi port
and lights the keys on Komplete Kontrol keyboard accordingly.

# Install

## Pre-requisites

- Install [LoopBe1](http://www.nerds.de/en/download.html) virtual midi port driver.

  ðŸ’¡ On Mac, you can use the built in "IAC Driver" - open "Audio midi setup" to create a device named "LoopBe" as [explained by D-One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fCx9_58kjU&t=220)

  **ðŸ†•New**: Since January 2023, check out [KompleteSynthesia](https://github.com/tillt/KompleteSynthesia): a MAC native project from [@tillt](https://github.com/tillt)
- In [Synthesia](https://synthesiagame.com):
  - Go to settings/Music Devices
  - Select "LoopBe Internal MIDI" from "Music Output"
  - In Keylight section of that output, select "Finger-based channel" (the last mode after 'channel 16')

### Linux, MAC

Use the [Developer method](#developer).

# Developer

If you want to contribute to the project, you need to setup your Python environment.

âš  SynthesiaKontrol only works with Python3. One of the symptom when using Python2 is that you will get an error message saying that the keyboard is not supported yet.

## SynthesiaKontrol

- Install Python's module:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the program: 

```
python3 SynthesiaKontrol.py
```

- Build executable (Windows)

  - Install cx_Freeze: `pip3 install cx_Freeze`
  - Run build
    ```
    python3 setup.py build
    ```
  - Result is in build directory.

# Status

- [X] Proof of concept: light keys from Komplete Kontrol MK2 S61
- [X] Figure out all the possible colors - see `color_scan.py`
- [X] Python app to listen to midi events from Synthesia and light keys - see `SynthesiaKontrol.py`
- [X] Leverage finger based channel light mode from Synthesia, introduced in r4376 to show left and right hands on KK
- [X] Address issue where notes are turned off too quickly (Forum post [here](https://www.synthesiagame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=45032#p45032))
- [X] Package as simple executable
- [X] All notes off
- [ ] Customizable note colors
- [ ] Rainbow mode: when playing a note, make a rainbow on that note
- [X] Simpler / better instructions
- [X] Support all Komplete Kontrol MK2 keyboard sizes (currently only S61)
- [X] Support Komplete Kontrol MK1 keyboards
- [ ] Use different colors per channel
